 Here is project that I wrote to have some practise using interesting 
 Android technologies that have a lot of features. 

 Firstly, it is Kotlin with syntactic sugar.     
     
 This project become reactive, because RxJava is here.
 
 Retrofit coming for easy network request.   
 
 In my opinion, it is good to have a history of your searching.  
 That is why, I use NoSQL DB Realm for saving all requests.
 
 It is all folks!
